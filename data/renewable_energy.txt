Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources today.
It converts sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells.
Over the last decade, the cost of solar panels has dropped by nearly 80%.

Wind energy, on the other hand, uses turbines to transform the kinetic energy
of air currents into mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.

Both solar and wind energy play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Governments around the world are investing heavily in renewable technologies
to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

However, renewable energy sources are intermittent. This is why new research
focuses on improving energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries.
